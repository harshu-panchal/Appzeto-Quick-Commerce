---

## Core Principles

### 1. Write for Everyone
- Use words that a 12-year-old can understand
- Avoid business jargon and technical terms
- Choose common words over fancy ones
- Keep sentences short (under 20 words)

### 2. Be Direct
- Say what you mean clearly
- Use active voice ("Save changes" not "Changes will be saved")
- Start with the action ("Add product" not "Product addition")
- Avoid unnecessary words

### 3. Be Consistent
- Use the same word for the same thing everywhere
- Don't switch between "remove," "delete," and "deactivate"
- Create a word list and stick to it

### 4. Be Helpful
- Explain what will happen
- Tell users what to do next
- Use positive language
- Avoid blame ("No orders found" not "You haven't created any orders")
